### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning JavaScript and web development. I'm working through The Odin Project because they have awesome JavaScript projects.

ðŸ”­ Latest exciting project: [(battleship)](https://mbeckdev.github.io/battleship/) -  a battleship game against a computer that used Jest to test the logic of the code before starting to code the visual dom parts. Jest, Webpack, HTML, CSS, JavaScript [code here](https://github.com/mbeckdev/battleship)

âš¡ Fun fact: I designed and 3D printed stands for the legs of my desk. Now my chair fits under the desk and doesn't bump into it!
