### Hi there 👋
🌱 I'm currently learning React and web development. I'm working through The Odin Project because they have tons of awesome projects.

🔭 Latest exciting project: 
- A couple tiny tiny CRUD apps to practice React with class components and with functional components with Hooks  
  - [(tiny-crud-class-components)](https://mbeckdev.github.io/tiny-crud-class-components/) and here's the [code](https://github.com/mbeckdev/tiny-crud-class-components)
  - [(tiny-crud-functional-components)](https://mbeckdev.github.io/tiny-crud-functional-components/) and here's the [code](https://github.com/mbeckdev/tiny-crud-functional-components)

⚡ Fun fact: I designed and 3D printed stands for the legs of my desk. Now my chair fits under the desk and doesn't bump into it!
