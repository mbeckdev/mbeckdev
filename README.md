### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Currently learning JavaScript. I'm working through The Odin Project because I hear they have awesome JavaScript projects.

ðŸ”­ Latest exciting project: (background-generator) Random color gradient generator that calculates RGB, HEX, and HSL.

âš¡ Fun fact: I designed and 3D printed my own mic stand. Now my mic doesn't have to roll all over my desk anymore!

- (google-homepage) Recreating the google search homepage in HTML and CSS.
