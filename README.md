### Hi there 👋
🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript and web development. I'm working through The Odin Project because I hear they have awesome JavaScript projects.

🔭 Latest exciting project: [(to-do list)](https://mbeckdev.github.io/to-do-list/) A CRUD project that saves your todo list that uses webpack, localStorage, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a third party library 'date-fns'


⚡ Fun fact: I designed and 3D printed stands for the legs of my desk. Now my chair fits under the desk and doesn't bump into it!
